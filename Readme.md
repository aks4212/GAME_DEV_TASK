I majorly worked as aprogrammer wrote different scripts, but also added some animations and made the game simple and working.
controls of the game :-
left, right arrow key to move left right respectively.
Space button to Attack.
up arrow key to jump.


main goal in the game is to kill the enemy and pass different levels and finally victory.
The number of hits required to kill the enemy is equal to the level number.
click on the 'Start Game' button to start  the game and 'Main Menu' buttom to return to the main menu
